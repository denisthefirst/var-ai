# VAR-AI (Video Assistant Referee Artificial Intelligence), detect handball with object detection and machine learning

The aim of this project is to develop an AI-supported assistance system
to support the video assistant referee (VAR) in soccer, specifically for
detecting potential handball. With the help of object recognition and
machine learning, a model is to be trained that analyzes match scenes
and recognizes whether a handball has occurred.
